# scrNumber
Scraping dangerous numbers

This my first scraping project.
This program scraping numbers from one page with comments and links to this numbers. 

Run main.py and paste link to page

Program will search data from site and write to csv file. 

In program I use packages like:
- BeautifulSoup
- datetime
- re
- time
- requests
- csv
- os
- logging
